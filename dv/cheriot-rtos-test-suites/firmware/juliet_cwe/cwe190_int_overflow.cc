// CWE-190: Integer Overflow leading to Out-of-Bounds Write
//
// This compartment uses a large (wrapping) integer index to access a
// stack-allocated array well beyond its bounds.  On a 32-bit CHERIoT system,
// the address arithmetic wraps around but the resulting address is nowhere
// near the 32-byte bounds of buf[], so CHERIoT raises a bounds exception.
//
// CHERIoT protection: buf[] has precise bounds of 32 bytes (8 × 4).
// ptr[0xFFFFFFFF] computes address = ptr + 0xFFFFFFFF * 4 = ptr + 0xFFFFFFFC
// (wrapping on 32-bit).  That address is outside the 32-byte bounds → CHERI
// bounds exception.
//
// Note: volatile on `idx` prevents constant folding that would allow the
// compiler to prove the access is UB and eliminate it.
